				<h2>How did I find out about Yoobee?</h2>
				<p>I decided I wanted learn how to "make pretty pictures for my desktop" and started searching online for somewhere I could learn how to use photoshop to create and manipulate imagery. Through a Google search I found Yoobee - and the rest is History!</p>

				<p>This will be my third course with the Yoobee Team.  I have also inspired family members to give it a go and my daughter - who successfully completed two courses at Yoobee - is now a full time Web Developer for a company in Australia and my nephew is enrolled in the Web Development course at Yoobee at this current time</p>
			</section>
			<section>			
				<h2>Why do I want to enrol?</h2>
				<p>I have always had a leaning towards all things computers:</p>
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>Building them</li>
					<li>Fixing them</li>
					<li>Playing games on them</li>
					<li>Learning how to use different software</li>
					<li>Making websites</li>
					<li>Getting creative!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>While completing my Certificate in Creative Media, I gained exposure to the wide world of Web Development - and loved it.  Although I couldn't enrol straight away onto the Web Development course due to financial constraints, it never left my mind as a career aspiration. Now that I am working for a large corporation that provides the ability to shift my career focus
				to that of a Web Developmer - and of course the TTAF scheme courtesy of the Government - I've finally arrived at the right time to "get back on that horse".</p>
			</section>

				<h2>What interests me about the course?</h2>
				<p>Yoobee has been a great place to learn in the past.  This course offers me the ability to study in the comfort of my own home, at my own pace, learning  something I have a keen interest in. Studying the Web Development course will give me the opportunity to get back to doing what I want to do,
				rather than what I have to do.  The content of the course is exactly what I need to know, to finally, shift into a career of my choice.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Aspirations in the creative industry</h2>
				<p>I've studied a number of different aspects in the computing world.
				From, building computers, to fixing them, to networking, to creating content.
				With the exposure and interests I've had so far, my interest in Web Development
				remains "the one ring to rule them all".</p>
