					<h2 class="h2-centered">CompTIA A+ Certified Computer Technician</h2>			
					<p>This is where my interests in computers began.
					I wanted to understand how the harware and software worked and how to build and fix my own and so, I did what any curious person would do - I put myself on a Computer Technican course.  With this course I became an A+ Certified Computer Technician and for a while, hardware was my jam. After a few years of building, fixing and selling desktop pc's and laptops, I decided I wanted to start concentrating of the software aspect of computing.</p>

					<h2 class="h2-centered">Certificate in IS&T for Small Business</h2>
					<p>After deciding to switch my focus away from hardware, to a more software related mode, I enrolled in a course in Information Systems and Technology for Small Business.  I learnt a wealth of information in how technology can benefit and add value to the operation of small to medium size enterprises and the plethroa of different applications that are available to support the needs of a business and the technological fundatmentals behind it all.</p>

					<h2 class="h2-centered">Certificate in Creative Media</h2>
					<p>Prior to joing the Diploma in Graphic Design course offered by Yoobee, I completed the Certicate in Creative Media course.  This is where I got my first exposure to Web Development and during that course, made my first website. It was simple and basic - not too dissimilar from this site - but this is where I decided that Web Development was actually what I want to do.  My plan was to do the Diploma in Graphic Design first and then complete the Web Development course after.  Unfortunately, life has a funny way of disrupting plans!</p>

					<h2 class="h2-centered">Diploma in Graphic Design</h2>
					<p>After completing Yoobee's Creative Media course, I enrolled in the Graphic Design Level 6 course. Initially, I wanted to start straight into the Web Development course, but decided I should also do Graphic Design first, to help complement the Web Development knowledge that was coming.  I abosulutely loved Graphic Design, but, with great sadness I had to return to full time employment after completing the Diploma in Graphic Design and was unable to take up Web Development to complete my learning journey.</p>
