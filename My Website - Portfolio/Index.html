				<p>Hi my name is Michele Carter and I've created this website to help showcase my existing html and 
				css knowledge, as well as provide you with the information you requested to be included
				in the portfolio such as <a href="why.html">why</a> I want to enrol, my educational<a href="background.html">
				background</a>, and some <a href="examples.html">examples</a> of my work.</p>
				
				<p>I have a keen interest in Web Development and have had previous exposure to coding when I was doing my Certificate in Creative Media at Yoobee in 2014.  Of all the aspects contained within that course, such as learning Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Premiere Pro etc, Web Development was what stood out for me the most.   After completing the creative media course, my goal was to then do Graphic Design and then do Web Development. Alas, financial constraints forced me back to full time employment after completing the Graphic Design course and I was unable to complete the Web Development course at the time as planned.</p>
				
				<p>Although I'm currently working as a Commercial Insurance Consultant, the company I work for is the largest insurer in Australiasia.  They have their own team of Web Developers and my goal is to gain the necessary tertiary competency to move into a Junior Front End Developer role within my Company.</p>
		
				<p>The introduction of the Governments Targeted Traning and Apprenticeship Fund and the ability to participate in the course, part-time from home, while still working, provides the opportunity for me to go back and study the Web Deveopment course and use it to shift my career goals away from Customer Service and into something I enjoy - Web Development.</p>
				
				<p>I hope you like this Website I created to show you that I have some fundamental knowledge that I would like to expanded on. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a> me.</p>
